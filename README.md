## add_prime_sum
        Assignment name  : add_prime_sum
        Expected files   : add_prime_sum.c
        Allowed functions: write, exit
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that takes a positive integer as argument and displays the sum
        of all prime numbers inferior or equal to it followed by a newline.

        If the number of arguments is not 1, or the argument is not a positive number,
        just display 0 followed by a newline.

        Yes, the examples are right.

        Examples:

        $>./add_prime_sum 5
        10
        $>./add_prime_sum 7 | cat -e
        17$
        $>./add_prime_sum | cat -e
        0$
        $>

## epur_str
        Assignment name  : epur_str
        Expected files   : epur_str.c
        Allowed functions: write
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that takes a string, and displays this string with exactly one
        space between words, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end,
        followed by a \n.

        A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
        by the start/end of the string.

        If the number of arguments is not 1, or if there are no words to display, the
        program displays \n.

        Example:

        $> ./epur_str "See? It's easy to print the same thing" | cat -e
        See? It's easy to print the same thing$
        $> ./epur_str " this        time it      will     be    more complex  . " | cat -e
        this time it will be more complex .$
        $> ./epur_str "No S*** Sherlock..." "nAw S*** ShErLaWQ..." | cat -e
        $
        $> ./epur_str "" | cat -e
        $
        $>

## expand_str
        Assignment name  : expand_str
        Expected files   : expand_str.c
        Allowed functions: write
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that takes a string and displays it with exactly three spaces
        between each word, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end,
        followed by a newline.

        A word is a section of string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or by the
        start/end of the string.

        If the number of parameters is not 1, or if there are no words, simply display
        a newline.

        Examples:

        $> ./expand_str "See? It's easy to print the same thing" | cat -e
        See?   It's   easy   to   print   the   same   thing$
        $> ./expand_str " this        time it      will     be    more complex  " | cat -e
        this   time   it   will   be   more   complex$
        $> ./expand_str "No S*** Sherlock..." "nAw S*** ShErLaWQ..." | cat -e
        $
        $> ./expand_str "" | cat -e
        $
        $>

## ft_atoi_base
        Assignment name  : ft_atoi_base
        Expected files   : ft_atoi_base.c
        Allowed functions: None
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a function that converts the string argument str (base N <= 16)
        to an integer (base 10) and returns it.

        The characters recognized in the input are: 0123456789abcdef
        Those are, of course, to be trimmed according to the requested base. For
        example, base 4 recognizes "0123" and base 16 recognizes "0123456789abcdef".

        Uppercase letters must also be recognized: "12fdb3" is the same as "12FDB3".

        Minus signs ('-') are interpreted only if they are the first character of the
        string.

        Your function must be declared as follows:

        int	ft_atoi_base(const char *str, int str_base);

## ft_list_size
        Assignment name  : ft_list_size
        Expected files   : ft_list_size.c, ft_list.h
        Allowed functions: None
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a function that returns the number of elements in the linked list that's
        passed to it.

        It must be declared as follows:

        int	ft_list_size(t_list *begin_list);

        You must use the following structure, and turn it in as a file called
        ft_list.h:

        typedef struct    s_list
        {
            struct s_list *next;
            void          *data;
        }                 t_list;

## ft_range
        Assignment name  : ft_range
        Expected files   : ft_range.c
        Allowed functions: malloc
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write the following function:

        int     *ft_range(int start, int end);

        It must allocate (with malloc()) an array of integers, fill it with consecutive
        values that begin at start and end at end (Including start and end !), then
        return a pointer to the first value of the array.

        Examples:

        - With (1, 3) you will return an array containing 1, 2 and 3.
        - With (-1, 2) you will return an array containing -1, 0, 1 and 2.
        - With (0, 0) you will return an array containing 0.
        - With (0, -3) you will return an array containing 0, -1, -2 and -3.

## ft_rrange
        Assignment name  : ft_rrange
        Expected files   : ft_rrange.c
        Allowed functions: malloc
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write the following function:

        int     *ft_rrange(int start, int end);

        It must allocate (with malloc()) an array of integers, fill it with consecutive
        values that begin at end and end at start (Including start and end !), then
        return a pointer to the first value of the array.

        Examples:

        - With (1, 3) you will return an array containing 3, 2 and 1
        - With (-1, 2) you will return an array containing 2, 1, 0 and -1.
        - With (0, 0) you will return an array containing 0.
        - With (0, -3) you will return an array containing -3, -2, -1 and 0.

## hidenp
        Assignment name  : hidenp
        Expected files   : hidenp.c
        Allowed functions: write
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program named hidenp that takes two strings and displays 1
        followed by a newline if the first string is hidden in the second one,
        otherwise displays 0 followed by a newline.

        Let s1 and s2 be strings. We say that s1 is hidden in s2 if it's possible to
        find each character from s1 in s2, in the same order as they appear in s1.
        Also, the empty string is hidden in any string.

        If the number of parameters is not 2, the program displays a newline.

        Examples :

        $>./hidenp "fgex.;" "tyf34gdgf;'ektufjhgdgex.;.;rtjynur6" | cat -e
        1$
        $>./hidenp "abc" "2altrb53c.sse" | cat -e
        1$
        $>./hidenp "abc" "btarc" | cat -e
        0$
        $>./hidenp | cat -e
        $
        $>

## lcm
        Assignment name  : lcm
        Expected files   : lcm.c
        Allowed functions: None
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a function who takes two unsigned int as parameters and returns the
        computed LCM of those parameters.

        LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of two non-zero integers is the smallest postive
        integer divisible by the both integers.

        A LCM can be calculated in two ways:

        - You can calculate every multiples of each integers until you have a common
        multiple other than 0

        - You can use the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of these two integers and
        calculate as follows:

            LCM(x, y) = | x * y | / HCF(x, y)

        | x * y | means "Absolute value of the product of x by y"

        If at least one integer is null, LCM is equal to 0.

        Your function must be prototyped as follows:

        unsigned int    lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b);

## paramsum
    Write a program that displays the number of arguments passed to it, followed by
    a newline.

    If there are no arguments, just display a 0 followed by a newline.

    Example:

    $>./paramsum 1 2 3 5 7 24
    6
    $>./paramsum 6 12 24 | cat -e
    3$
    $>./paramsum | cat -e
    0$
    $>

## pgcd
        Assignment name  : pgcd
        Expected files   : pgcd.c
        Allowed functions: printf, atoi, malloc, free
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that takes two strings representing two strictly positive
        integers that fit in an int.

        Display their highest common denominator followed by a newline (It's always a
        strictly positive integer).

        If the number of parameters is not 2, display a newline.

        Examples:

        $> ./pgcd 42 10 | cat -e
        2$
        $> ./pgcd 42 12 | cat -e
        6$
        $> ./pgcd 14 77 | cat -e
        7$
        $> ./pgcd 17 3 | cat -e
        1$
        $> ./pgcd | cat -e
        $

## print_hex
        Assignment name  : print_hex
        Expected files   : print_hex.c
        Allowed functions: write
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that takes a positive (or zero) number expressed in base 10,
        and displays it in base 16 (lowercase letters) followed by a newline.

        If the number of parameters is not 1, the program displays a newline.

        Examples:

        $> ./print_hex "10" | cat -e
        a$
        $> ./print_hex "255" | cat -e
        ff$
        $> ./print_hex "5156454" | cat -e
        4eae66$
        $> ./print_hex | cat -e
        $

## rstr_capitalizer
        Assignment name  : rstr_capitalizer
        Expected files   : rstr_capitalizer.c
        Allowed functions: write
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that takes one or more strings and, for each argument, puts
        the last character that is a letter of each word in uppercase and the rest
        in lowercase, then displays the result followed by a \n.

        A word is a section of string delimited by spaces/tabs or the start/end of the
        string. If a word has a single letter, it must be capitalized.

        A letter is a character in the set [a-zA-Z]

        If there are no parameters, display \n.

        Examples:

        $> ./rstr_capitalizer | cat -e
        $
        $> ./rstr_capitalizer "a FiRSt LiTTlE TESt" | cat -e
        A firsT littlE tesT$
        $> ./rstr_capitalizer "SecONd teST A LITtle BiT   Moar comPLEX" "   But... This iS not THAT COMPLEX" "     Okay, this is the last 1239809147801 but not    the least    t" | cat -e

## str_capitalizer
        Assignment name  : str_capitalizer
        Expected files   : str_capitalizer.c
        Allowed functions: write
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that takes one or several strings and, for each argument,
        capitalizes the first character of each word (If it's a letter, obviously),
        puts the rest in lowercase, and displays the result on the standard output,
        followed by a \n.

        A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
        by the start/end of the string. If a word only has one letter, it must be
        capitalized.

        If there are no arguments, the progam must display \n.

        Example:

        $> ./str_capitalizer | cat -e
        $
        $> ./str_capitalizer "a FiRSt LiTTlE TESt" | cat -e
        A First Little Test$
        $> ./str_capitalizer "__SecONd teST A LITtle BiT   Moar comPLEX" "   But... This iS not THAT COMPLEX" "     Okay, this is the last 1239809147801 but not    the least    t" | cat -e

        Expected files   : tab_mult.c
        Allowed functions: write
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Write a program that displays a number's multiplication table.

        The parameter will always be a strictly positive number that fits in an int,
        and said number times 9 will also fit in an int.

        If there are no parameters, the program displays \n.

        Examples:

        $>./tab_mult 9
        1 x 9 = 9
        2 x 9 = 18
